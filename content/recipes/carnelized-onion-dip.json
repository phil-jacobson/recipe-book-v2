Add the chopped onions and cook until translucent and starting to color, about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>If at any point during the cooking of the onions they start to dry out, add a tablespoon of water to the pot.<br/><br/>Stir in the brown sugar, balsamic, salt, and pepper. Lower the heat and cook gently, uncovered, for about 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are nicely caramelized.<br/><br/>Then set aside. (You can caramelize the onions up to 2 days ahead and chill until you make the dip.) Let cool a bit before adding to the other ingredients."
