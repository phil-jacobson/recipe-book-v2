    "description": "Recipe video above. Thai Chicken Peanut Noodles is what you make when you&#039;ve got less than 15 minutes to get dinner on the table and you need a Thai fix! Using chicken mince means no meat prep - and you can switch it out with literally any ground meat (beef, turkey, pork). It might not be authentic Thai ... but it&#039;s fast and 100% delicious!",
